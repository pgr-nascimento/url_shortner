# UrlShortner

This application was made as part of STORD's hiring process.

In this application we can input an URL and shorten it to a smaller one, with this new URL the application can
redirects from the shorten URL to the original.

## What was used
- [Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir) the main language
- [Phoenix](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix) is the framework that uses elixir to create WebApplication
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) the default database of Phoenix
- [Credo](https://github.com/rrrene/credo) to analyze the code and suggests good practices.

## What next?

in this file. Please, go there and see my notes :D
